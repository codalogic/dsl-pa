// dsl-pa is a Domain Specific Language Parsing Assistant library designed to
// take advantage of the C++ logic shortcut operators such as && and ||.
// dsl-pa function calls extract sections of language input based on a
// specified alphabet.  Calls to dsl-pa functions are combined using the C++
// shortcut operators in order to parse a language in a reasonably compact
// form.  Consequently all dsl-pa functions return either a boolean value or
// a value, such as an integer, that can be implicitly converted to a bool.
// For more information see README.html at https://github.com/codalogic/dsl-pa
