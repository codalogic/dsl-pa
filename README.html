<h1>dsl-pa Documentation</h1>
<p>dsl-pa is a Domain Specific Language Parsing Assistant library designed to
take advantage of the C++ logic shortcut operators such as && and ||.
dsl-pa function calls extract sections of language input based on a
specified alphabet.  Calls to dsl-pa functions are combined using the C++
shortcut operators in order to parse a language in a reasonably compact
form.  Consequently all dsl-pa functions return either a boolean value or
a value, such as an integer, that can be implicitly converted to a bool.

Yes, yes, I know, there's not much here.  Give me a chance.

<p>
P.S. This is a place holder!

<h2>Project Status</h2>
<p>This project is still under development and NOT yet ready for thrid-party use.</p>

<h1>Character sets</h1>
<p>
The language input is assumed to be in UTF-8 encoding and operations are done on C++ <code>char</code>s.
</p>
<p>
A value of <code>0</code> is used to indicate the end of input has been reached.
