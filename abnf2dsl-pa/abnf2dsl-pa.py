# Basic script to convert an ABNF definition into outline C++ dsl-pa code.
# It won't do a perfect job, but will hopefully do some of the initial
# grunt work.
#
# It's strongly recommended that you rename the generated files before working
# on them to avoid accidentally overwriting them.
#
# Usage:
#     abnf2dsl-pa.py <src.abnf> <base-C++-file-name>
